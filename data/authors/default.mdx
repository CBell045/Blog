Chad Bell is an aspiring data scientist and frisbee enthusiast. He grew up on a fish farm in Frazeysburg, Ohio, served a mission in California, and now attends Brigham Young University-Idaho (which he loves!). He and his wife Courtney are the classic old folks: they love playing card games, getting eight hours of sleep, and serving in the temple.
